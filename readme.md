LEDGradCap
==========

The goal of this course is to create a device that can be given to each graduating ECE senior to wear at graduation.  The device will be battery powered and sized that it can be worn on the graduation cap, ideally clipped on rather than permanently affixed.  The device will have multiple LEDs and a three axis accelerometer.  The accelerometer can be used to measure movement which will translate to varying LED patterns.
